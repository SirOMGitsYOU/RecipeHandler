### This is a Minecraft modification based on Minecraft Forge

This has been updated for minecraft 1.12.2 combining some community made changes and restoring the CurseForge page.

If you have two different mods that have the same recipe using the same materials, then you got a conflict, and you would have no way to get access to all the items by the intended means.

This mod allows multiple recipes sharing the same crafting layout to be crafted, the player being able to choose using either a cycle button, or a new key binding.

How many recipes are conflicting is also displayed.

See generated configuration file: `recipehandler.cfg` for options.


This mod makes the best efforts to support other crafting tables, using an automated detection system, but gives no guarantee that the behavior will match the desired outcome.


### Mod installation procedure:
* Install [Forge](https://files.minecraftforge.net/)
* Download the mod and put it in your mods folder (or mods/'mc version' starting from 1.6.2)
